	Modelers},
  booktitle = {EGI Community Forum 2014},

  abstract = {Impact modeling forced by climate data is often connected with big
	data processing. But impact modelers are often not equipped with
	appropriate hardware (computing and storage facilities) or appropriate
	programming experience. Web Processing Service (WPS) is an open standard
	defined by the Open Spatial Consortium (OGC). It is an interface
	to perform processes over the HTTP network protocol. This tutorial
	in an introduction to an early stage of the ClimDaPs project. ClimDaPs
	is using WPS for climate data processing. It is based on the PyWPS
	implementation of WPS and provides additionally a simple web-based
	user-interface to access and combine climate data processes. It provides
	access to the climate data archive of the Earth System Grid Federation
	(ESGF) for CMIP5 and CORDEX data. Performing simple processes of
	climate data up to complex impact models are already available within
	ClimDaPs. One can also visualize climate data and processed results.
	Besides the introduction of existing processing possibilities, we
	will show how you can add your own climate data processes to ClimDaPs
	and other WPS services.},

  abstract = {Data play a central role in most fields of science. In recent years,
	the amount of data from experiment, observation, and simulation has
	increased rapidly and data complexity has grown. Also, communities
	and shared storage have become geographically more distributed. Therefore,
	methods and techniques applied to scientific data need to be revised
	and partially be replaced, while keeping the community-specific needs
	in focus. The German Helmholtz Association project "Large Scale Data
	Management and Analysis" (LSDMA) aims to maximize the efficiency
	of data life cycles in different research areas, ranging from high
	energy physics to systems biology. In its five Data Life Cycle Labs
	(DLCLs), data experts closely collaborate with the communities in
	joint research and development to optimize the respective data life
	cycle. In addition, the Data Services Integration Team (DSIT) provides
	data analysis tools and services which are common to several DLCLs.
	This paper describes the various activities within LSDMA and focuses
	on the work performed in the DLCLs.},
