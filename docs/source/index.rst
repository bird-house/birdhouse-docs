Introduction
============

Birdhouse is a collection of :term:`Web Processing Service` (WPS) related
Python components to support data processing in the climate science
community. The aim of Birdhouse is to make the usage of WPS easy. Most
of the :term:`OGC`/:term:`WPS` related software comes from the :term:`GeoPython` project. 

Birdhouse is the home of the following WPS components (birds):

* :ref:`Phoenix <phoenix:introduction>`: a web-based WPS client with ESGF data access
* :ref:`Malleefowl <malleefowl:introduction>`: access to climate data (ESGF, ...) as a service and library
* :ref:`Flyingpigeon <flyingpigeon:introduction>`: services for the climate impact community
* :ref:`Hummingbird <hummingbird:introduction>`: provides cdo and cfchecker as a service
* :ref:`Emu <emu:introduction>`: some example WPS processes
* :ref:`Birdy <birdy:introduction>`: a WPS command line tool

You can find the source code of all Birdhouse components on
`our GitHub page <http://github.com/bird-house>`_. 
:term:`Conda` packages for Birdhouse are available on the `birdhouse channel <https://binstar.org/birdhouse>`_ on Binstar.
:term:`Docker` images with Birdhouse components are on `Docker Hub <https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/birdhouse/>`_
