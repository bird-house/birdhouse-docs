.. _introduction:

Introduction
============

Birdhouse is a collection of `Web Processing Service`_ (WPS) related
Python components to support data processing in the *climate science*
community. We use the Python implemention of WPS, PyWPS_, and the Python OWS library OWSLib_
from the GeoPython_ Project.

Birdhouse is used in the following projects:

* CP4CDS: Climate Projects for the `Climate Data Store`_ (part of the European Union's `Copernicus Climate Change Service`_).
* PAVICS_: Platform for climate analysis and visualization by Ouranos_ and CRIM_, Canada.

Many climate analysis operations are implemented using OpenClimateGIS_.
