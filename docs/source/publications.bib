  abstract = {Impact modeling forced by climate data is often connected with big
	data processing. But impact modelers are often not equipped with
	appropriate hardware (computing and storage facilities) or appropriate
	programming experience. Web Processing Service (WPS) is an open standard
	defined by the Open Spatial Consortium (OGC). It is an interface
	to perform processes over the HTTP network protocol. This tutorial
	in an introduction to an early stage of the ClimDaPs project. ClimDaPs
	is using WPS for climate data processing. It is based on the PyWPS
	implementation of WPS and provides additionally a simple web-based
	user-interface to access and combine climate data processes. It provides
	access to the climate data archive of the Earth System Grid Federation
	(ESGF) for CMIP5 and CORDEX data. Performing simple processes of
	climate data up to complex impact models are already available within
	ClimDaPs. One can also visualize climate data and processed results.
	Besides the introduction of existing processing possibilities, we
	will show how you can add your own climate data processes to ClimDaPs
	and other WPS services.},
