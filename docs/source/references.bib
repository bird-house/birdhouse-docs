This work comprises technical practice as well as social practice, both of which are distinguished by their massive scale and global reach. As a result, the amount of data involved in climate research is growing at an unprecedented rate. Some examples of the types of activities that increasingly require an improved cyberinfrastructure for dealing with large amounts of critical scientific data are climate model intercomparison (CMIP) experiments; the integration of observational data and climate reanalysis data with climate model outputs, as seen in the Observations for Model Intercomparison Projects (Obs4MIPs), Analysis for Model Intercomparison Projects (Ana4MIPs), and Collaborative Reanalysis Technical Environment-Intercomparison Project (CREATE-IP) activities; and the collaborative work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This article provides an overview of some of climate science's big data problems and the technical solutions being developed to advance data publication, climate analytics as a service, and interoperability within the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), which is the primary cyberinfrastructure currently supporting global climate research activities.},

@PHDTHESIS{Brauner2015,
  author = {J. Brauner},
  title = {Formalizations for geooperators-geoprocessing in Spatial Data Infrastructures},
  school = {Technische Universität Dresden, Fakultät Umweltwissenschaften},
  year = {2015},
  type = {Dissertation},
  month = {10},
  abstract = {Nowadays, geoprocessing has moved in large parts from isolated desktop
	usage into the Web. Thereby, the overall availability of geoprocessing
	functionality has theoretically improved. Nevertheless, web-based
	geoprocessing functionality is still not readily available and usable
	as means to find and subsequently compare functionality are yet missing.
	Discoverability and exchangeability of geoprocessing functionality
	are limited, and the fundamental benefits of online usage are not
	fully exploited. To close this gap, this thesis defines a conceptualization
	with geooperators representing well-defined geoprocessing functionality,
	and categories representing distinct geooperator attributes as a
	starting point. Geooperators and categories are connected by associative
	and hierarchical links forming an interlinked network. The conceptualization
	serves as basis for two purposes: On the one hand, discovery of geooperators
	has to be improved. There is a multitude of different GIS users from
	varying backgrounds, all having a slightly different view on geoprocessing
	functionality. To embrace these varying views, several actually existing
	and established categorizations for geooperators are integrated into
	the conceptualization and structured hierarchically. Thus, multiple
	different perspectives on geooperators are enabled. The perspectives
	and the underlying categorizations are integrated into a geooperator
	browser serving as client that users can employ for discovery. The
	geooperator browser offers a faceted browsing interface based on
	the derived perspectives and categories. Several different search
	modes are offered and can be used simultaneously, thereby facilitating
	an improved discovery. On the other hand, to establish comparability
	and subsequently semantically interoperable exchangeability of geooperators,
	respective geooperator attributes are defined. Thereby, backend and
	provider independence of geoprocessing services is achieved. The
	conceptualization is formalized to allow for machine readability
	and processing which is required for usage in Spatial Data Infrastructures
	and the Semantic Web. The formalized conceptualization is labeled
	geooperator thesaurus. It is encoded by Semantic Web standards and
	offered in a Semantic Web compliant manner. The integration into
	geoprocessing service metadata is enabled by injecting semantic annotations
	that link to the respective concepts in the geooperator thesaurus.
	The thesaurus serves as the underlying data model for the geooperator
	browser. The thesis concludes with an outlook and discussions of
	future work. Foremost, the content of the geooperator thesaurus needs
	to be extended as it currently only comprises a representative subset
	of geooperators. An approach is suggested to involve the geoprocessing
	community as an important source of geoprocessing expertise in the
	maintenance and further development of the thesaurus. On a conceptual
	level, the thesaurus needs to be extended to a fully-fledged ontology

  abstract = {Environmental modeling often requires the use of multiple data sources,
	models, and analysis routines coupled into a workflow to answer a
	research question. Coupling these computational resources can be
	accomplished using various tools, each requiring the developer to
	follow a specific protocol to ensure that components are linkable.
	Despite these coupling tools, it is not always straight forward to
	create a modeling workflow due to platform dependencies, computer
	architecture requirements, and programming language incompatibilities.
	A service-oriented approach that enables individual models to operate
	and interact with others using web services is one method for overcoming
	these challenges. This work advances the idea of service-oriented
	modeling by presenting a design for a modeling service that builds
	from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Service
	(WPS) protocol. We demonstrate how the \{WPS\} protocol can be used
	to create modeling services, and then demonstrate how these modeling
	services can be brought into workflow environments using generic
	client-side code. We implemented this approach within the HydroModeler
	environment, a model coupling tool built on the Open Modeling Interface
	standard (version 1.4), and show how a hydrology model can be hosted
	as a \{WPS\} web service and used within a client-side workflow.
	The primary advantage of this approach is that the server-side software
	follows an established standard that can be leveraged and reused
	within multiple workflow environments and decision support systems.

	by defi-

	nition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic
	changes in

	their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records.
	However,

	there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community
	in the extent

	to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced
	cli-

	mate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies
	seek to

	determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered
	the probabil-

	ity or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence
	for human

	influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm
	seasonal

	temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal
	tempera-

	tures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence
	on the prob-

	ability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more
	mixed.

	Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in
	recent years,

	geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests
	and

	capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational
	event

	attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of
	attribution

	assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event
	attribution

	assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties
	need to be

	robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires
	the conti-

	nuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event

	results and further work to understand the potential utility of event

  abstract = {Given the coarse spatial resolution of General Circulation Models,
	finer scale projections of variables affected by local-scale processes
	such as precipitation are often needed to drive impacts models, for
	example in hydrology or ecology among other fields. This need for
	high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called
	downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches:
	dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted
	by various statistical families conceptually different. If several
	studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models,
	none of them included all those families and approaches in a manner
	that all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present
	study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX
	initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models
	(SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms
	of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by
	the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989--2008 period over a common
	area at 0.44{\textdegree} of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated
	according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity,
	as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one
	or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The
	results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and
	intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based
	SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled
	by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have
	to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators
	and could change when considering other specific criteria. The indicators
	suit specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results
	depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use
	with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison
	exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework,
	including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i.e.,
	other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally,
	this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to
	be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale
	climate data to drive properly specific impact models.},

  abstract = {The derivation of local scale information from integrations of coarse-resolution
	general circulation models (GCM) with the help of statistical models
	fitted to present observations is generally referred to as statistical
	downscaling. In this paper a relatively simple analog method is described
	and applied for downscaling purposes. According to this method the
	large-scale circulation simulated by a GCM is associated with the
	local variables observed simultaneously with the most similar large-scale
	circulation pattern in a pool of historical observations. The similarity
	of the large-scale circulation patterns is defined in terms of their
	coordinates in the space spanned by the leading observed empirical
	orthogonal functions.

	The method can be checked by replicating the evolution of the local
	variables in an independent period. Its performance for monthly and
	daily winter rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula is compared to more
	complicated techniques, each belonging to one of the broad families
	of existing statistical downscaling techniques: a method based on
	canonical correlation analysis, as representative of linear methods;
	a method based on classification and regression trees, as representative
	of a weather generator based on classification methods; and a neural
	network, as an example of deterministic nonlinear methods.

	It is found in these applications that the analog method performs
	in general as well as the more complicated methods, and it can be
	applied to both normally and nonnormally distributed local variables.
	Furthermore, it produces the right level of variability of the local
	variable and preserves the spatial covariance between local variables.
	On the other hand linear multivariate methods offer a clearer physical
	interpretation that supports more strongly its validity in an altered
	climate. Classification and neural networks are generally more complicated
	methods and do not directly offer a physical interpretation.},
