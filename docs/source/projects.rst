The birdhouse :ref:`framework is modular organized <framework_structure>` to enable a flexible architecture design depending on the projects needs. Due to the OCG Standard, software components non-birdhouse components can be combined for interoperability. Here are some examples of real projects to show the flexibility and potential of the birdhouse framework.

PAVICS
......

* PAVICS_: Platform for climate analysis and visualization by Ouranos_ and CRIM_, Canada.
* PAVICS-Hydro_ : Additional services for PAVICS_ allowing users to perform hydrological modeling and analysis.

DACCS
.....

* DACCS_: *Data Analytics for Canadian Climate Services* is a collaboration between the `University of Toronto`_,
  the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC_), the Computer Research Institute of Montr√©al (CRIM_), and Ouranos_.

  This project evolved from `PAVICS`_ developments, by extending Birdhouse_ services with multiple new capabilities,
  and providing an *Infrastructure as Code* (IaC) `birdhouse-deploy`_ definition allowing the customizable selection
  of server `components <https://birdhouse-deploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#birdhouse>`_.

COPERNICUS
..........

* CP4CDS: Climate Projects for the `Climate Data Store`_ (part of the European Union's `Copernicus Climate Change Service`_).

OGC-Testbeds
............

.. todo:: Add references to OGC testbed.

* OGC Testbed 13: Enhancement of scheduling services
* OGC Testbed 14: Enhancement of security
