  abstract = {Data play a central role in most fields of science. In recent years,
	the amount of data from experiment, observation, and simulation has
	increased rapidly and data complexity has grown. Also, communities
	and shared storage have become geographically more distributed. Therefore,
	methods and techniques applied to scientific data need to be revised
	and partially be replaced, while keeping the community-specific needs
	in focus. The German Helmholtz Association project "Large Scale Data
	Management and Analysis" (LSDMA) aims to maximize the efficiency
	of data life cycles in different research areas, ranging from high
	energy physics to systems biology. In its five Data Life Cycle Labs
	(DLCLs), data experts closely collaborate with the communities in
	joint research and development to optimize the respective data life
	cycle. In addition, the Data Services Integration Team (DSIT) provides
	data analysis tools and services which are common to several DLCLs.
	This paper describes the various activities within LSDMA and focuses
	on the work performed in the DLCLs.},
