abstract = {With the implementation specification of the Web Processing Service (WPS), a standard to process spatial data on the web is available from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This new possibility in web-based information systems allow an interoperable processing of different data based on service-oriented architectures. This paper describes requirements and an implementation for web-based processing and workflow creation to generate and provide remote sensing products like fire hotspot points and land surface temperatures based on NASA MODIS data. Therefore, a WPS as well as service chains to process these remote sensing products are implemented. PyWPS is used as WPS and tested with focus on processing remote sensing data. To chain the developed processes, software like 52° North Orchestration Engine, Apache ODE and internal software for executing processing chains and providing a workflow as WPS process are tested. A Web-GIS with open-source software was developed to manage started and finished processes, to search for available satellite data and to create processing chains interactively. An interface to retrieve and process archived data was integrated; the user of this system can search interactively for archived satellite data and process it with the developed processing services and workflows. The Web-GIS also acts as a WPS client, client for visualizing processed data and creator as well as security layer for processing chains. These developments and research work show that there is additional work to improve the WPS specification for example by adding domain-specific profiles for working with large raster data to define standardised rules for data-exchange between the processes. In the field of process orchestration, no standardised data format describing processing chains exists yet.},

abstract = {The first United Nations World Data Forum (UNWDF) took place in Cape Town, South Africa, in January 2017. At that Forum, the foundations were laid for a new joint endeavour to explore opportunities and identify good practices for enhancing data interoperability in the area of sustainable development. These aims are today embodied in the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability. The Collaborative was formally established at a side-event to the 48th UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) which took place in March 2017. It is convened by the UN Statistical Division (UNSD) and Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD). Over the past two years, the Collaborative has grown significantly in size, with over 90 individuals representing entities from across the data for development spectrum – from official statistics representatives to local civil society groups – now engaged in its processes, discussions and events. The Collaborative is founded on the belief that data interoperability can: a) help to generate better quality and more holistic information that can facilitate in the achievement and monitoring of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); and b) help to foster more coordinated, coherent and datadriven cooperation and collaboration between official statistical entities and the broader data ecosystem. At the Data for Development Festival in Bristol in March 2017, the Collaborative agreed to produce guidance on data interoperability for development practitioners. This document is the first attempt at producing such guidance. It is our hope that it provides a useful starting point for statisticians, government officials, development practitioners responsible for data management, as well as suppliers of information and communication technologies (ICT) solutions in the development sector. As this Guide will further explain, interoperability is both a characteristic of good quality data and a concept that can be used to help frame data management policies.},

Technical infrastructures as well as principles and recommendations for data citation are in place but best practices or guidelines for their implementation are not yet available. On the other hand, the scientific climate community requests early citations on evolving data for credit, e.g. for CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). The data citation concept for CMIP6 is presented. The main challenges lie in limited resources, a strict project timeline and the dependency on changes of the data dissemination infrastructure ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) to meet the data citation requirements. Therefore a pragmatic, flexible and extendible approach for the CMIP6 data citation service was developed, consisting of a citation for the full evolving data superset and a data cart approach for citing the concrete used data subset. This two citation approach can be implemented according to the RDA recommendations for evolving data. Because of resource constraints and missing project policies, the implementation of the second part of the citation concept is postponed to CMIP7.},

abstract = {Extreme events are an expression of natural climate variability. Since anthropogenic emissions affect global climate, it is natural to wonder whether recent observed extreme events are a manifestation of anthropogenic climate change. This thesis aims at contributing to the understanding of the influence of anthropogenic climate change on observed extreme events, while assessing whether and how this scientific information – and more generally, the science of extreme event attribution (EEA) – could be useful for society. I propose statistical tools to achieve the former, while relying on qualitative interviews for the latter. The statistical part focuses on European heatwaves. I quantify the role played by the atmospheric circulation in the intensity of four recent heatwaves. This analysis is based on flow analogues, which identify days with a similar circulation pattern than the event of interest. I then disentangle the influence of climate change on the dynamical and non-dynamical processes leading to heatwaves. I calculate trends in the occurrence of circulation patterns leading to high temperatures and trends in temperature for a fixed circulation pattern, applied to the 2003 Western Europe and 2010 Russia heatwaves. I find that the significance of the results depend on the event of interest, highlighting the value of calculating trends for very specific types of circulation. The epistemological part evaluates the potential social uses of extreme event attribution. I assess how it could inform international climate negotiations, more specifically loss and damage, in response to a number of claims from scientists going in this direction. I find that the only potential role EEA could play to boost the loss and damage agenda would be to raise awareness for policy makers, aside from the negotiation process itself. I also evaluate how the different motivations stated by EEA scientists in interviews fare compared to the existing evidence on social use of this type of scientific information. I show that the social relevance of EEA results is ambiguous, and that there is a lack of empirical data to better understand how different non-scientific stakeholders react and appropriate EEA information},

abstract = {Sectorial applications of seasonal forecasting require data for a reduced number of variables from different datasets, mainly (gridded) observations, reanalysis, and predictions from state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems (such as NCEP/CFSv2, ECMWF/System4 or UKMO/GloSea5). Whilst this information can be obtained directly from the data providers, the resulting formats, temporal aggregations, and vocabularies may not be homogeneous across datasets. Moreover, different data policies hold for the different databases, being only some of them publicly available. Therefore, obtaining and harmonizing multi-model seasonal forecast data for sector-specific applications is an error-prone, time consuming task. In order to facilitate this, the ECOMS User Data Gateway (ECOMS-UDG) was developed in the framework of the ECOMS initiative as a one-stop-service for climate data. To this aim, the variables required by end users were identified, downloaded from the data providers and locally stored as virtual datasets in a THREDDS Data Server (TDS), implementing fine-grained user management and authorization via the THREDDS Access Portal (TAP). As a result, users can retrieve the subsets best suited to their particular research needs in a user-friendly manner using the standard TDS data services. Moreover, an open source, R-based interface for data access and postprocessing was developed in the form of a bundle of packages implementing harmonized data access (one single vocabulary), data collocation, bias adjustment and downscaling, and forecast visualization and validation. This provides a unique comprehensive framework for end-to-end applications of seasonal predictions, hence favoring the reproducibility of the ECOMS scientific outcomes, extensible to the whole scientific community.},

abstract = {The climate change agenda is populated by actors and agencies with different objectives, values, and motivations, yet many seek decision scale climate information to inform policy and adaptation responses. A central element of this network of activity is the climate information website (CIW) that has seen a rapid and organic growth, yet with variable content and quality, and unfettered by any code of practice. This builds an ethical–epistemic dilemma that warrants assessment as the presence of CIWs contribute to real-world consequences and commitment. This study considers the context of CIW growth, and reviews a representative sample of CIWs to draw out key issues for consideration in CIW development. We assess content, function, and use-case value through a dual approach of a typology and user experience narratives to evaluate the general efficacy of a CIW. The typology reveals strong contrasts in content, complicated interfaces, and an overload of choice making it difficult to converge on a stable outcome. The narratives capture user experience and highlight barriers that include navigation difficulties, jargon laden content, minimal or opaque guidance, and inferred information without context about uncertainty and limits to skill. This illuminates four concerns: (1) the ethics of information provision in a context of real-world consequences; (2) interfaces that present barriers to achieving robust solutions; (3) weak capacity of both users and providers to identify information of value from the multimodel and multimethod data; and (4) inclusion of data that infer skill. Nonetheless, results provide a positive indication of a community of practice that is still maturing. WIREs Clim Change 2017, 8:e470. doi: 10.1002/wcc.470.

The generator then simulates spatially coherent time series of a climate variable, drawn from meteorological observations. The weather generator is tested for European temperatures, and for winter and summer seasons.

It focuses, specifically, on the creation and development of climate services, and highlights a number of difficulties that have limited the success of these services. Among them are the insufficient awareness by societal actors of their vulnerability to climate change, the lack of relevant products and services offered by the scientific community, the inappropriate format in which the information is provided, and the inadequate business model adopted by climate services. The authors suggest that, to be effective, centers should host within the same center a diversity of staff including experts in climate science, specialists in impact, adaptation, and vulnerability, representatives of the corporate world, agents of the public service as well as social managers and communication specialists.

abstract = {Estimating animal populations by direct counting is an essential component of wildlife conservation and management. However, conventional approaches (i.e., ground survey and aerial survey) have intrinsic constraints. Advances in image data capture and processing provide new opportunities for using applied remote sensing to count animals. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using very high resolution multispectral satellite images for animal detection, but to date, the practicality of detecting animals from space using panchromatic imagery has not been proven. This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect and count large mammals (e.g., wildebeests and zebras) from a single, very high resolution GeoEye-1 panchromatic image in open savanna. A novel semi-supervised object-based method that combines a wavelet algorithm and a fuzzy neural network was developed. To discern large mammals from their surroundings and discriminate between animals and non-targets, we used the wavelet technique to highlight potential objects. To make full use of geometric attributes, we carefully trained the classifier, using the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system. Our proposed method (with an accuracy index of 0.79) significantly outperformed the traditional threshold-based method (with an accuracy index of 0.58) detecting large mammals in open savanna.},

Web portals (i.e., web sites) for disseminating information are important tools in meeting this challenge, and therefore, we assessed the characteristics of select major portals across multiple scales. We found that there is a rather limited number of case studies available in the portals-between 900 and 1000 in total-with 95 that include cost information and 195 that include the participation of stakeholders globally. Portals are rarely cited by researchers, suggesting a suboptimal connection between the practical, policy-related, and scientific development of adaptation. The government portals often lack links on search results between US and European Union (EU) web sites, for example. With significant investments and policy development emerging in both the United States and the European Union, there is great potential to share information via portals. Moreover, there is the possibility of better connecting the practical adaptation experience from bottom-up projects to the science of adaptation.},

abstract = {The application of climate change impact assessment (CCIA) studies in general and especially the linkages between different actor groups typically involved is often not trivial and subject to many limitations and uncertainties. Disciplinary issues like competing downscaling approaches, imperfect climate and impact model data and uncertainty propagation as well as the selection of appropriate data sets are only one part of the story. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary challenges add to these, as climate data and impact model data provision and their usage require at least a minimum of common work and shared understanding among actors. Here, we provide the VALUE perspective on current disciplinary challenges and limitations at the downscaling interface and elaborate transdisciplinary issues that hamper a proper working downscaling interface. The perspective is partly based on a survey on user needs of downscaled data that was distributed among 62 participants across Europe involving 22 sectors. Partly, it is based on the exchanges and experiences gained during the lifetime of VALUE that brought together different actor groups of different disciplines: climate modellers, impact modellers, statisticians and stakeholders. We outline a sketch that summarizes the linkages between the main identified actor groups: climate model data providers, impact modellers and societal users. We summarize review and structure current actors groups, needs and issues. We argue that this structuring enables involved actors to tackle these issues in a more organized and hence effective way. A key solution to several difficulties at the downscaling interface is to our understanding the development of guidelines based on benchmark tests like the VALUE framework. In addition, fostering communication between actor groups—and financing this communication—is essential to obtain the best possible CCIA as a prerequisite for robust adaptation.},

abstract = {Two states of the atmosphere which are observed to resemble one another are termed analogues. Eitherstate of a pair of analogues may be regarded as equal to the other state plus a small superposed "error."From the behavior of the atmosphere following each state, the growth rate of the error may be determined. Five years of twice-daily height values of the 200-, 500-, and 850-mb surfaces at a grid of 1003 pointsover the Northern Hemisphere are procured. A weighted root-mean-square height difference is used as ameasure of the difference between two states, or the error. For each pair of states occurring within onemonth of the same time of year, but in different years, the error is computed. There are numerous mediocre analogues but no truly good ones. The smallest errors have an averagedoubling time of about 8 days. Larger errors grow less rapidly. Extrapolation with the aid of a quadratichypothesis indicates that truly small errors would double in about 2.5 days. These rates may be comparedwith a 5-day doubling time previously deduced from dynamical considerations. The possibility that the computed growth rate is spurious, and results only from having superposedthe smaller errors on those particular states where errors grow most rapidly, is considered and rejected. Thelikelihood of encountering any truly good analogues by processing all existing upper-level data appearsto be small.},

abstract = {The present study focuses on the chronological relationship between alternating dune sand and silty water-lain sediments in the central part of the Khongoryn Els dune field in the Gobi Desert, Southern Mongolia. The 23 m high section evolved from the construction of a natural dam by west-east moving sand dunes and fluvial inundation by a river system from the mountain ranges in the south. To resolve the chronology of events, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was applied and from sedimentological and geochemical analysis the depositional processes could be characterised. Quartz OSL dating of these sediments is hindered by feldspar contamination. Thus, dating of coarse-grain K-feldspars is applied to provide a more reliable chronostratigraphy. As this fraction might be influenced by signal loss over geological time scales, the ex tent of fading is measured and corrected for. The resulting ages fit well in a supraregional reconstruction of Central Asian palaeoclimate. The data imply that the basal aeolian sediments were deposited 27 ka ago, while the major part of the profile was accumulated in a rather short period of time around ∼15 ka. The temporal differentiation implies that the stratification of aeolian and fluvial sediments is not caused by long term climatic variations. It rather represents arid conditions with episodical fluvial activity. Samples between 20 and 15 m depth could not be taken, but it is assumed that this part of the section represents an extremely arid time period with an intensive remobilisation of sand around LGM. A dune overlying the section was deposited during the Late Holocene and represents the ongoing aridity in this region. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AU-Agenda 2063 was adopted at the 24th Ordinary Session of the African Heads of State and Government in 2015 as the blueprint for the future development of the continent. Built upon the continent's past experiences, challenges, and successes, AU-Agenda 2063 comprehensively describes the strategic path for Africa's future development in the next 50 years. Thus, the monitoring of its implementation in various African states is critical for ensuring sustainable development and track progress. However, the higher cost of collecting data for accurately and reliably monitoring the implementation of Agenda 2063 may hinder the progress towards achieving these goals. Satellite Earth observation provides ample data, and thus has provided opportunities for the development of novel products and services with the potential to support implementation, monitoring and reporting for AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. However, it has been limitedly exploited in Africa, as evidenced by lower research outputs and investments. This calls for increased capacity building in the use of available EO data and products for various users including decision makers to advance national, regional and continental priorities. The use of such data products is often hampered by the capability to understand the products and thus their value for addressing socio-economic challenges. This paper discusses the potential of Earth observation capacity building for supporting the implementation, monitoring of, and reporting towards achieving AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. Specifically, this paper identifies existing capacity building resources, including the role of open and free Earth observation data, open-source software, and product dissemination platforms that can be leveraged for supporting national development, service delivery and the achievement of AU-Agenda 2063 targets. Furthermore, the paper recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships in leveraging existing know-how, technology and other resources for advancing strategic goals of African emerging space agencies and promoting sustainable development, with examples from South African National Space Agency (SANSA). Then, the challenges and opportunities for capacity building and the wide adoption of EO in Africa are discussed in the context of AU-Agenda 2063. The paper thus concludes that EO capacity building is essential to address the skills and data gaps and increase the use of EO-based solutions for decision making in various sectors, critical for achieving AU-A2063.},

The research and discussion are based on interviews and written responses from 29 interviewees from international organisations, national LDN working groups, and civil society organisations involved in different phases of LDN initiatives. It finds that LDN target setting has proceeded in many countries using the default data provided by the UNCCD due to limited national datasets. Consultation of government ministries has generally been strong, but the involvement of the private sector and civil society in LDN working groups needs to be strengthened. The response hierarchy has been integrated as a principle in some national land use planning systems, and activities fostering synergistic outcomes for other social and environmental goals are beginning to be harnessed to achieve LDN.},

abstract = {This paper explores key issues in the development of open access to research data. The use of digital means for developing, storing and manipulating data is creating a focus on ‘data-driven science'. One aspect of this focus is the development of ‘open access' to research data. Open access to research data refers to the way in which various types of data are openly available to public and private stakeholders, user communities and citizens. Open access to research data, however, involves more than simply providing easier and wider access to data for potential user groups. The development of open access requires attention to the ways data are considered in different areas of research. We identify how open access is being unevenly developed across the research environment and the consequences this has in terms of generating data gaps. Data gaps refer to the way data becomes detached from published conclusions. To address these issues, we examine four main areas in developing open access to research data: stakeholder roles and values; technological requirements for managing and sharing data; legal and ethical regulations and procedures; institutional roles and policy frameworks. We conclude that problems of variability and consistency across the open access ecosystem need to be addressed within and between these areas to ensure that risks surrounding a data gap are managed in open access.},

abstract = {Nowadays, geoprocessing has moved in large parts from isolated desktop usage into the Web. Thereby, the overall availability of geoprocessing functionality has theoretically improved. Nevertheless, web-based geoprocessing functionality is still not readily available and usable as means to find and subsequently compare functionality are yet missing. Discoverability and exchangeability of geoprocessing functionality are limited, and the fundamental benefits of online usage are not fully exploited. To close this gap, this thesis defines a conceptualization with geooperators representing well-defined geoprocessing functionality, and categories representing distinct geooperator attributes as a starting point. Geooperators and categories are connected by associative and hierarchical links forming an interlinked network. The conceptualization serves as basis for two purposes: On the one hand, discovery of geooperators has to be improved. There is a multitude of different GIS users from varying backgrounds, all having a slightly different view on geoprocessing functionality. To embrace these varying views, several actually existing and established categorizations for geooperators are integrated into the conceptualization and structured hierarchically. Thus, multiple different perspectives on geooperators are enabled. The perspectives and the underlying categorizations are integrated into a geooperator browser serving as client that users can employ for discovery. The geooperator browser offers a faceted browsing interface based on the derived perspectives and categories. Several different search modes are offered and can be used simultaneously, thereby facilitating an improved discovery. On the other hand, to establish comparability and subsequently semantically interoperable exchangeability of geooperators, respective geooperator attributes are defined. Thereby, backend and provider independence of geoprocessing services is achieved. The conceptualization is formalized to allow for machine readability and processing which is required for usage in Spatial Data Infrastructures and the Semantic Web. The formalized conceptualization is labeled geooperator thesaurus. It is encoded by Semantic Web standards and offered in a Semantic Web compliant manner. The integration into geoprocessing service metadata is enabled by injecting semantic annotations that link to the respective concepts in the geooperator thesaurus. The thesaurus serves as the underlying data model for the geooperator browser. The thesis concludes with an outlook and discussions of future work. Foremost, the content of the geooperator thesaurus needs to be extended as it currently only comprises a representative subset of geooperators. An approach is suggested to involve the geoprocessing community as an important source of geoprocessing expertise in the maintenance and further development of the thesaurus. On a conceptual level, the thesaurus needs to be extended to a fully-fledged ontology including a formal geoprocessing algebra to support the creation of geooperator workflows. From a discovery point of view, the concept of geoprocessing patterns is outlined. Geoprocessing patterns list geooperators that are commonly used for certain geoprocessing tasks, and provide best practices about applying them in a meaningful manner and sequence.},

Their roles and possible advancements according to the Digital Earth vision and implementation require investigations. This paper presents a review of the literature concerning geoportals and serves the following primary purposes. First, various geoportal approaches for discovering and accessing Earth observation data and geo-information, mainly with scientific purposes, are summarized according to their characteristics and functionalities. Second, current major challenges in geoportals are identified in terms of functionalities, technologies, and especially big data support, from geoportal cases of China. Finally, based on lessons learned from the international and Chinese geoportals, solutions and recommendations for the challenges in geoportals are proposed in terms of their architectures, services, and technologies. The results show that geoportals usually provide access to distributed data systems, offering maps, data discovery, and data downloads. Some of them are also capable of offering online analysis and processing service, enhanced semantic search engines, and dynamic visualization tools. The strength of geoportals could lead to a full-fledged online Digital Earth system that could provide better data sharing and dissemination solutions to the challenges posed by big data.},

The core benefit of this project is to allow the seamless use of climate services developed by a diverse network of national meteorological offices, regional climate service providers, academics, not-for-profit research centers and private industry. As governments move toward open-data policies, there will be a need for analytical services that extract value out of the deluge of information.

@article{Vaittinada2016,
abstract = {Given the coarse spatial resolution of General Circulation Models, finer scale projections of variables affected by local-scale processes such as precipitation are often needed to drive impacts models, for example in hydrology or ecology among other fields. This need for high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches: dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted by various statistical families conceptually different. If several studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models, none of them included all those families and approaches in a manner that all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989–2008 period over a common area at 0.44 of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity, as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators and could change when considering other specific criteria. The indicators suit specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework, including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i.e., other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally, this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale climate data to drive properly specific impact models.},

Here we analyse 17 national and representative use cases so as to identify the diversity of the demand for climate information depending on user profiles as well as the best practices, methods and tools that are needed to answer the different requests. A particular emphasis is put on the workflow that allows to translate climate data into suitable impact data, the way to deal with the different sources of uncertainty and to provide a suited product to users. We identified three complementary tools to close the gap between climate scientists and user needs: an efficient interface between users and providers; an optimized methodology to handle user requests and a portal to facilitate access to data and elaborated products. We detail in the paper how these three tools can limit the intervention of experts, educate users, and lead to the production of useful information.

abstract = {Climate services involve the timely production, translation, and delivery of useful climate data, information, and knowledge for societal decision-making. They rely on a range of expertise and are underpinned by research in climate and related sciences, sectoral applications (e.g., agriculture, water, health, energy, disasters), and a number of social science fields, including political science, sociology, anthropology, and economics. Feedback and engagement between these research communities and the communities involved in developing and/or using climate services is thus critical, ensuring that climate services are built on the best available science and providing researchers with guidance regarding priority challenges in the development of climate services that should warrant their attention. This paper reports the results of an international survey to gauge community perspective on research priorities for climate services, highlighting several areas in which respondents agree on the need for future work. The survey results indicate an overarching interest in research that can better connect climate information to users, particularly around the communication of climate information, the mapping of climate information needs, and the evaluation and prioritization of capacity building efforts. They also reveal significant interest in climate research to advance the skill of forecasts at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales – considered more broadly useful to decision makers than information at the end-of-century timescale – and to identify the drivers of extreme events. To support climate-related research, survey respondents underscore the need to continually develop and maintain the observational network. In analyzing these results, the paper offers guidance to researchers and to other members of the climate services community that may find these priorities useful in directing their own work to address the challenges posed by climate variability and change.},

In its five Data Life Cycle Labs (DLCLs), data experts closely collaborate with the communities in joint research and development to optimize the respective data life cycle. In addition, the Data Services Integration Team (DSIT) provides data analysis tools and services which are common to several DLCLs.

abstract = {As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, countries are striving to achieve by 2030 a land degradation neutral world. Land degradation neutrality (LDN) is the state whereby the amount and quality of land resources remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales. Achieving this will require the uptake of sustainable land management (SLM) practices to increase the sustainable provision of ecosystem goods and services the human population will require. It will also require the development of systematic, robust, and validated methods for tracking progress at project, subnational and national scales. However, to date, no systematic comparison between the SLM practices and the indicators proposed for monitoring LDN has been performed. In this article, we used the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification primary recommended global sustainable land management database of World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), and an innovative tool designed to assess and monitor land condition via changes in land productivity, Trends.Earth, to evaluate the agreement between self-reported sustainable land management technologies and indicators derived from satellite-based earth observations. We found that a combination of two primary productivity indicators derived from annual integrals of normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), trajectory and state, were able to identify increases in primary productivity in the locations where the SLM practices are implemented in comparison to control sites where SLM practices are not known to have occurred. Moreover, different SLM practices showed unique responses in terms of proportional area which experienced increase, decrease, or remained stable terms of primary productivity. We also found that the time since establishment of the SLM technology was critical for identifying improvements in the SLM sites, as only technologies with more than 10 years since implementation show statistically significant improvements. Our results show that satellite-derived land productivity indicators are successful at detecting the impacts of SLM practices on primary productivity, positioning them as essential elements of the monitoring and assessment tools needed to track land condition to assure the achievement of a land degradation neutral world.},

abstract = {Reproducibility should be a key concern for any scientific discipline. For climate science, however, the difficulties and demands appear even more pronounced than for other fields within science. The main difficulties arise from the fact that we have only one specimen of planet Earth which cannot be studied under laboratory conditions. This implies that climate scientists are left with either observing the present-day climate system (with all the challenges of incomplete and noisy measurements) or using computer models (which can provide only an incomplete representation of the complex Earth system) or investigating Earth's climate history (then being forced to rely on approximate climate reconstructions from so-called proxy data). Despite these difficulties, the demands on reproducibility in climate science are particularly high because of the tremendous importance of the research results for our society facing the challenges of climate change. In practice, this societal scrutiny of climate science is exceedingly exacerbated by public assaults on particular results (and often also on the scientists responsible for providing these results) by individuals or organizations disagreeing with the notion of anthropogenic climate change or its adverse impacts. In this contribution I will discuss examples highlighting the challenges for reproducibility for observational climate science, climate modeling, and paleoclimate research. Furthermore, I will give specific recommendations how reproducibility in climate science can be further improved.},

Moreover, climate change has been identified as a central challenge for sustainable development by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Data provide the basis for a reliable scientific understanding and knowledge as well as the foundation for services that are required to take informed decisions. In consequence, there is an increasing need for translating the massive amount of climate data and information that already exists into customized tools, products and services to monitor the range of climate change impacts and their evolution. It is crucial that these data and information should be made available not in the way that they are collected, but in the way that they are being used by the largest audience possible.Considering that climate data is part of the broader Earth observation and geospatial data domain, the aim of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art geospatial technologies that can support the delivery of efficient and effective climate services, and enhancing the value chain of climate data in support of the objectives of the Global Framework for Climate Services.

abstract = {<p>This article extends a previous study (Seneviratne et al., 2016) to provide regional analyses of changes in climate extremes as a function of projected changes in global mean temperature. We introduce the DROUGHT-HEAT Regional Climate Atlas, an interactive tool to analyse and display a range of well-established climate extremes and water-cycle indices and their changes as a function of global warming. These projections are based on simulations from the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). A selection of example results are presented here, but users can visualize specific indices of interest using the online tool. This implementation enables a direct assessment of regional climate changes associated with global temperature targets, such as the 2 degree and 1.5 degree limits agreed within the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>},

abstract = {By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

abstract = {We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the period 1950-2006. This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.

However, there is also an opportunity to capitalise on the synergies that exist between LDN objectives and those of existing market-based instruments that have previously been developed for carbon, biodiversity, bioenergy and in other contexts. LDN objectives could be integrated into such schemes through targeted eligibility rules and certification schemes, supporting methodologies, adaptations to multifunctional indices used in auction-based approaches and the restructuring of mandates, tax breaks and feed-in tariffs for bioenergy and other products.},

abstract = {The world's commitment towards land degradation neutrality (LDN) became enshrined in various international agreements and decisions throughout the year 2015. The challenge now becomes one of addressing its operation, in order to achieve these new policy goals and targets by the year 2030. Advancing LDN demands attention to what the concept seeks to achieve, as well as unravelling the perspectives of the key multi-lateral environmental agreements through which progress can be made. The three Rio Conventions (the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)) all play key roles in shaping the international LDN governance and implementation context. Their different but related foci create a number of challenges and opportunities for advancing LDN. In this paper we critically analyze the literature to elucidate potential challenges and opportunities in moving LDN towards implementation, considering the mandates and objectives of all three Rio Conventions. We first unpack the concept of LDN's aspirations. We highlight the importance of the definitions and terminology used, and the relationships between those definitions, terms and the actors using them, as well as their implications in framing the range of policy actions and synergies that could benefit progress towards multiple Sustainable Development Goals. We then examine the LDN pilot project spearheaded by the UNCCD to identify key lessons for LDN implementation. Synthesizing these lessons, we present a portfolio of blended interventions that seeks to address the aspirations of the UNCCD, UNFCCC and CBD in the LDN space, identifying synergistic options for national actions to move towards LDN. Overall, our analysis provides insights in advancing LDN from its current position as a policy target, towards synergetic action.},

CORE-CLIMAX assessed the European capability to provide climate data records (CDRs) of essential climate variables (ECVs), prepared a structured process to derive CDRs, developed a harmonized approach for validating essential climate variable CDRs, identified the integration of CDRs into the reanalysis chain, and formulated a process to compare the results of different reanalysis techniques. With respect to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the systematic application and further development of the CORE-CLIMAX system maturity matrix (SMM) and the spinoff application performance metric (APM) were strongly endorsed to be involved in future implementations of C3S. We concluded that many of the current CDRs are not yet sufficiently mature to be used in reanalysis or applied in climate studies. Thus, the production of consistent high-resolution data records remains a challenge that needs more research urgently. Extending ECVs to close climate cycle budgets (e.g., essential water variables) is a next step linking CDRs to sectoral applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Analyses of extreme weather events and their impacts often requires big data processing of ensembles of climate model simulations. Researchers generally proceed by downloading the data from the providers and processing the data files “at home” with their own analysis processes. However, the growing amount of available climate model and observation data makes this procedure quite awkward. In addition, data processing knowledge is kept local, instead of being consolidated into a common resource of reusable code. These drawbacks can be mitigated by using a web processing service (WPS). A WPS hosts services such as data analysis processes that are accessible over the web, and can be installed close to the data archives. We developed a WPS named ‘flyingpigeon' that communicates over an HTTP network protocol based on standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), to be used by climatologists and impact modelers as a tool for analyzing large datasets remotely. Here, we present the current processes we developed in flyingpigeon relating to commonly-used processes (preprocessing steps, spatial subsets at continent, country or region level, and climate indices) as well as methods for specific climate data analysis (weather regimes, analogues of circulation, segetal flora distribution, and species distribution models). We also developed a novel, browser-based interactive data visualization for circulation analogues, illustrating the flexibility of WPS in designing custom outputs. Bringing the software to the data instead of transferring the data to the code is becoming increasingly necessary, especially with the upcoming massive climate datasets.},

Historic abundance time series were used to identify the key weather conditions associated with bank vole abundance, and were extrapolated to future climate scenarios to derive potential long-term changes in bank vole abundance dynamics. Results: Classification and regression tree analysis revealed the most relevant weather parameters associated with high and low bank vole abundances. Summer temperatures 2 years prior to trapping had the highest impact on abundance fluctuation. Extrapolation of the identified parameters to future climate conditions revealed an increase in years with high vole abundance. Conclusion: Key weather patterns associated with vole abundance reflect the importance of superabundant food supply through masting to the occurrence of bank vole outbreaks. Owing to changing climate, these outbreaks are predicted potentially to increase in frequency 3-4-fold by the end of this century. This may negatively affect damage patterns in forestry and the risk of human PUUV infection in the long term.},

@article{Riahi2017,
abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

abstract = {Linked Science is the practice of inter-connecting scientific assets by publishing, sharing and linking scientific data and processes in end-to-end loosely coupled workflows that allow the sharing and re-use of scientific data. Much of this data does not live in the cloud or on the Web, but rather in multi-institutional data centers that provide tools and add value through quality assurance, validation, curation, dissemination, and analysis of the data. In this paper, we make the case for the use of scientific scenarios in Linked Science. We propose a scenario in river-channel transport that requires biogeochemical experimental data and global climate-simulation model data from many sources. We focus on the use of ontologies-formal machine-readable descriptions of the domain-to facilitate search and discovery of this data. Mercury, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a tool for distributed metadata harvesting, search and retrieval. Mercury currently provides uniform access to more than 100,000 metadata records; 30,000 scientists use it each month. We augmented search in Mercury with ontologies, such as the ontologies in the Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) collection by prototyping a component that provides access to the ontology terms from Mercury. We evaluate the coverage of SWEET for the ORNL Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). {\textcopyright} 2013 # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract = {Environmental modeling often requires the use of multiple data sources, models, and analysis routines coupled into a workflow to answer a research question. Coupling these computational resources can be accomplished using various tools, each requiring the developer to follow a specific protocol to ensure that components are linkable. Despite these coupling tools, it is not always straight forward to create a modeling workflow due to platform dependencies, computer architecture requirements, and programming language incompatibilities. A service-oriented approach that enables individual models to operate and interact with others using web services is one method for overcoming these challenges. This work advances the idea of service-oriented modeling by presenting a design for a modeling service that builds from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Service (WPS) protocol. We demonstrate how the WPS protocol can be used to create modeling services, and then demonstrate how these modeling services can be brought into workflow environments using generic client-side code. We implemented this approach within the HydroModeler environment, a model coupling tool built on the Open Modeling Interface standard (version 1.4), and show how a hydrology model can be hosted as a WPS web service and used within a client-side workflow. The primary advantage of this approach is that the server-side software follows an established standard that can be leveraged and reused within multiple workflow environments and decision support systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article presents both the development over time of these methods and tools and methodological considerations. Two full-scale impact evaluations were undertaken: the first on protected areas in Eastern Africa and the second on the GEF portfolio of projects supporting the removal from production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in countries with economies in transition. In addition several other impact studies were undertaken. The evaluations of various aspects of the progress from outcome to impact were gathered and as far as possible aggregated in the Fourth Overall Performance Study of the GEF, which was presented in 2009 to the replenishment process of the GEF. An overview is presented of progress toward impact of the GEF portfolio of finished projects on climate change mitigation and on stemming the loss of biodiversity. The Office will continue to develop and use the variety of impact evaluation tools at its disposal.},

Whether this anomaly and recent warming in Europe can be linked to changes in atmospheric dynamics is a key question in the climate change prospective. We show that despite the fall/winter atmospheric flow was favorable to warmth, it cannot explain alone such an exceptional anomaly. Observed temperatures remained well above those found for analogue atmospheric circulations in other fall and winter seasons. Such an offset is also found during the last decade and culminates in 2006/2007. These observational results suggest that the main drivers of recent European warming are not changes in regional atmospheric flow and weather regimes frequencies, contrasting with observed changes before 1994.},

abstract = {The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development stresses the fundamental role science should play in implementing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals endorsed by the global community. But how can and should researchers respond to this societal demand on science? We argue that answering this question requires systematic engagement with the fundamental normative dimensions of the 2030 Agenda and those of the scientific community---and with the implications these dimensions have for research and practice. We suggest that the production of knowledge relevant to sustainable development entails analytic engagement with norms and values through four tasks. First, to unravel and critically reflect on the ethical values involved in sustainability, values should increasingly become an empirical and theoretical object of sustainability research. Second, to ensure that research on social--ecological systems is related to sustainability values, researchers should reflect on and spell out what sustainability values guide their research, taking into account possible interdependencies, synergies, and trade-offs. Third, to find common ground on what sustainability means for specific situations, scientists should engage in deliberative learning processes with societal actors, with a view to jointly reflecting on existing development visions and creating new, contextualized ones. Fourth, this implies that researchers and scientific disciplines must clarify their own ethical and epistemic values, as this defines accountability and shapes identification of problems, research questions, and results. We believe that ignoring these tasks, whether one is in favor or critical of the 2030 Agenda, will undermine the credibility and relevance of scientific contributions for sustainable development.},

abstract = {The Belt and Road initiative has a significant focus on infrastructure, trade, and economic development across a vast region, and it also provides significant opportunities for sustainable development. The combined pressure of climate variability, intensified use of resources, and the fragility of ecosystems make it very challenging, however, to achieve future sustainability. To develop the path in a sustainable way, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of these issues across nations and evaluate them in a scientific and well-informed approach. In this context, the Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) program was initiated as an international venture to share expertise, knowledge, technologies, and data to demonstrate the role of Earth observation science and technology and big Earth data applications to support large-scale development. In this paper, we identify pressing challenges, present the research priorities and foci of the DBAR program, and propose solutions where big Earth data can make significant contributions. This paper calls for further joint actions and collaboration to build a digital silk road in support of sustainable development at national, regional and global levels.},

abstract = {This handbook, written by members of the United Nations Task Team on Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Data, provides a guide for National Statistical Offices considering using satellite imagery (known as earth observations) data for official statistics. It was produced as an input to the United Nation Global Working Group on Big Data for Official Statistics report to the United Nations Statistical Commission for 2017. The handbook provides a brief introduction to the use of earth observations (EO) data for official statistics, types of sources available and methodologies for producing statistics from this type of data. It also summarises the results of four pilot projects produced by Task Team members; Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Australia, Instituto Nacional de Estad{\'{i}}stica Geograf{\'{i}}ca e Inform{\'{a}}tica (INEGI), Mexico, Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE), Colombia and Google. Supplementary material includes a methodology literature review, and the full reports of the pilot projects. In the final chapter, guidelines are presented for National Statistical Offices to consider and refer to when considering whether to implement earth observations data sources into their statistical production process, and issues to consider throughout the implementation and output processes. Rather than being prescriptive, the guidelines are intended to prompt National Statistical Office to critically consider their own business needs, and apply the recommendations as appropriate to their circumstances. As the international experience using these data for statistical purposes grows, National Statistical Offices can build on the guidelines provided in this handbook with their own expertise and knowledge.},

abstract = {The recognition of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification's (UNCCD) failure to reduce the rate of desertification and its social and economic repercussions, and the attribution of this failure to lack of strong political will rather than to weak science and malpractice of land users, triggered the emergence of the land degradation neutrality (LDN) paradigm. After agreeing to a formal definition of LDN in 2015, an LDN Scientific Conceptual Framework was developed and endorsed by UNCCD Member States in September 2017. In parallel over 110 UNCCD Member States began implementing LDN, including the preparation for assessment of baseline data, LDN target setting, and monitoring LDN indicators. This paper examines the development of the scientific basis for LDN and how the team of global scientific experts in neutrality approaches worked in parallel with the teams who were conducting training events to launch the LDN target setting programme (TSP). We then move from the scientific conceptual framework to the challenges in the arena of policy making and policy implementation that are becoming visible in ongoing activities related to LDN implementation. We examine these challenges and the opportunities for the development of an enabling policy environment for implementing LDN at country-level, including opportunities for increased financing for achieving LDN. We then present two TSP examples, of Madagascar and Italy, for illustrating early lessons learned on the ground.},

In this article, we present a framework for persistent identification that fundamentally supports context information. It is installed as a number of low-level requirements and abstract data type descriptions, flexible enough to envelope context information while remaining compatible with existing definitions and infrastructures. The abstract data type definitions we draw from the requirements and exemplary use cases can act as an evaluation tool for existing implementations or as a blueprint for future persistent identification infrastructures. A prototypic implementation based on the Handle System is briefly introduced. We also lay the groundwork for establishing a graph of persistent entities that can act as a base layer for more sophisticated information schemas to preserve context information.},

abstract = {A2C2 investigated rare and extreme events of a dynamical system such as the climate. We focused on chaotic dynamical systems, which yield a strange attractor, and we aim at detecting how an alteration of the system leads to new, rare or extreme events. The general tools that we developed are measures of pattern recurrence and assess when patterns have never been seen before. The tools are based on analogues of atmospheric circulation, which have been known for decades in the meteorological literature for weather forecast. We have demonstrated their potential in climate applications, especially for diagnostics of extreme events. The A2C2 project contained three workpackages (WPs). WP1 made a (previously unseen) link between statistics and the theory of dynamical systems, by relating extreme events to rare occurrences. This relation enabled us to devise tools to investigate the predictability of extreme climate events of spatial fields (rather than looking at time series). WP1 also aimed at measuring how strange attractors can be altered. We found a link with optimal transport theory to quantify such alterations. WP2 was meant to devise efficient computer tools and web based applications so that the methods that are developed in WP1 can be easily used. We distribute the codes on the A2C2 web site (through a CECILL free license). A continuous time analysis of atmospheric variability is also proposed on the A2C2 web page. We designed a web processing service with a visualisation tool to compute analogues on any atmospheric database (including CMIP5/6). WP3 focused on the applications of analogues of circulation perform extreme event attribution. We have devised a methodology to compute dynamical and thermodynamical contributions to extreme precipitation events from large ensembles of simulations. We have also shown that such contributions can be determined from rather small datasets, at a fraction of the cost of the large ensembles. Overall, the scope of A2C2 extended from applied mathematics and nonlinear dynamics to concrete applications in extreme event attribution and social sciences. A2C2 supported 6 postdoctoral positions and 3 PhD students, most of whom have obtained permanent positions.},

A number of national and international initiatives such as the Climate Service Partnership, or the Climate Science for Services Partnership between China and the UK, were designed to build upon such an international framework. The role of the European Commission appears to be very prominent in the international climate services landscape as it supported a largenumber of research and innovation programmes in the field. The chapter discusses the role climate services could play for the energy sector starting from an analysis of the interactions that already exist and building upon a few specific examples that indicate some good practice in climate service development.},

At the core of this movement, research objects contain and describe scientific information and resources in a way compliant with the FAIR principles and sustain the development of key infrastructure and tools. This paper provides an account of the challenges, experiences and solutions involved in the adoption of FAIR around research objects over several Earth Science disciplines. During this journey, our work has been comprehensive, with outcomes including: an extended research object model adapted to the needs of earth scientists; the provisioning of digital object identifiers (DOI) to enable persistent identification and to give due credit to authors; the generation of content-based, semantically rich, research object metadata through natural language processing, enhancing visibility and reuse through recommendation systems and third-party search engines; and various types of checklists that provide a compact representation of research object quality as a key enabler of scientific reuse. All these results have been integrated in ROHub, a platform that provides research object management functionality to a wealth of applications and interfaces across different scientific communities. To monitor and quantify the community uptake of research objects, we have defined indicators and obtained measures via ROHub that are also discussed herein.},

@article{VonBieberstein2019,
abstract = {Abstract Eight conventions make up the biodiversity cluster of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) that provide the critical international legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of nature. However, concerns about the rate of implementation of the conventions at the national level have triggered discussions about the effectiveness of these MEAs in halting the loss of biodiversity. Two main concerns have emerged: lack of capacity and resources and lack of coherence in implementing multiple conventions. We focused on the latter and considered the mechanisms by which international conventions are translated into national policy. Specifically, we examined how the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and the associated Aichi Biodiversity Targets have functioned as a unifying grand plan for biodiversity conservation. This strategic plan has been used to coordinate and align targets to promote and enable more effective implementation across all biodiversity-related conventions. Results of a survey of 139 key stakeholders from 88 countries suggests streamlining across ministries and agencies, improved coordination mechanisms with all relevant stakeholders, and better knowledge sharing between conventions could improve cooperation among biodiversity-related conventions. The roadmap for improving synergies among conventions agreed to at the 13th Convention on Biological Diversity's Conference of Parties in 2016 includes actions such as mechanisms to avoid duplication in national reporting and monitoring on conventions and capacity building related to information and knowledge sharing. We suggest the scientific community can actively engage and contribute to the policy process by establishing a science-policy platform to address knowledge gaps; improving data gathering, reporting, and monitoring; developing indicators that adequately support implementation of national plans and strategies; and providing evidence-based recommendations to policy makers. The latter will be particularly important as 2020 approaches and work to develop a new biodiversity agenda for the next decade is beginning.},

abstract = {Many changes in European surface climate have occurred over the past decades, but most of the processes driving them are not identified. In particular, the role of atmospheric flow in driving surface trends needs to be evaluated to better predict future regional climate. We compare observed surface climate trends with those constructed from daily flow analogues. We find that during the last 60 years atmospheric circulation changes are the main drivers of surface weather trends in winter, but not in summer where temperature strongly interacts with the water cycle. For instance, increasing anticyclonic conditions control the decreasing summer rainfall frequency, but rainfall amount and cloud cover have not decreased accordingly, because individual rainfall events bring more rain now than decades ago. Over the past three decades the control by atmospheric flow changes has weakened, indicating evolutions in the processes steering European surface climate change.},

abstract = {Decision making processes and their outcomes can be affected by a number of factors. Among them, the quality of the data is critical. Poor quality data cause poor decisions. Although this fact is widely known, data quality (DQ) is still a critical issue in organizations because of the huge data volumes available in their systems. Therefore, literature suggests that communicating the DQ level of a specific data set to decision makers in the form of DQ metadata (DQM) is essential. However, the presence of DQM may overload or demand cognitive resources beyond decision makers' capacities, which can adversely impact the decision outcomes. To address this issue, we have conducted an experiment to explore the impact of DQM on decision outcomes, to identify different groups of decision makers who benefit from DQM and to explore different factors which enhance or otherwise hinder the use of DQM. Findings of a statistical analysis suggest that the use of DQM can be enhanced by data quality training or education. Decision makers with a certain level of data quality awareness used DQM more to solve a decision task than those with no data quality awareness. Moreover, those with data quality awareness reached a higher decision accuracy. However, the efficiency of decision makers suffers when DQM is used. Our suggestion would be that DQM can have a positive impact on decision outcomes if it is associated with some characteristics of decision makers, such as a high data quality knowledge. However, the results do not confirm that DQM should be included in data warehouses as a general business practice, instead organizations should first investigate the use and impact of DQM in their setting before maintaining DQM in data warehouses.},

abstract = {The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Service (WPS) standard enables access to a centralized repository of processes and services from compliant clients. A crucial part of the standard includes the provision to chain disparate processes and services to form a reusable workflow. To date this has been realized by methods such as embedding XML requests, using Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) engines and other external orchestration engines. Although these allow the user to define tasks and data artifacts as web services, they are often considered inflexible and complicated, often due to vendor specific solutions and inaccessible documentation. This paper introduces a new method of flexible service chaining using the standard Business Process Markup Notation (BPMN). A prototype system has been developed upon an existing open source BPMN suite to illustrate the advantages of the approach. The motivation for the software design is qualification of crowdsourced data for use in policy-making. The software is tested as part of a project that seeks to qualify, assure, and add value to crowdsourced data in a biological monitoring use case.},

abstract = {Extreme weather and climate-related events occur in a particular place, by definition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence for human influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm seasonal temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal temperatures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence on the probability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more mixed. Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in recent years, geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests and capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational event attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of attribution assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event attribution assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties need to be robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires the continuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event attribution results and further work to understand the potential utility of event attribution for stakeholder groups and decision makers.},

abstract = {A new high-resolution regional climate change ensemble has been established for Europe within the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) initiative. The first set of simulations with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to follow. The aim of this paper is to present this data set to the different communities active in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and they provide a significantly different climate change of daily precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak to moderate and high intensities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {The derivation of local scale information from integrations of coarse-resolution general circulation models (GCM) with the help of statistical models fitted to present observations is generally referred to as statistical downscaling. In this paper a relatively simple analog method is described and applied for downscaling purposes. According to this method the large-scale circulation simulated by a GCM is associated with the local variables observed simultaneously with the most similar large-scale circulation pattern in a pool of historical observations. The similarity of the large-scale circulation patterns is defined in terms of their coordinates in the space spanned by the leading observed empirical orthogonal functions. The method can be checked by replicating the evolution of the local variables in an independent period. Its performance for monthly and daily winter rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula is compared to more complicated techniques, each belonging to one of the broad families of existing statistical downscaling techniques: a method based on canonical correlation analysis, as representative of linear methods; a method based on classification and regression trees, as representative of a weather generator based on classification methods; and a neural network, as an example of deterministic nonlinear methods. It is found in these applications that the analog method performs in general as well as the more complicated methods, and it can be applied to both normally and nonnormally distributed local variables. Furthermore, it produces the right level of variability of the local variable and preserves the spatial covariance between local variables. On the other hand linear multivariate methods offer a clearer physical interpretation that supports more strongly its validity in an altered climate. Classification and neural networks are generally more complicated methods and do not directly offer a physical interpretation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present a statistical method to reconstruct continuous atmospheric fields on various pressure levels, given a constraint at the surface. The method is based on analogues of circulation and taking into consideration the time sequence of the analogues. The method is tested on the 2001–2011 period, with an emphasis on the year 2010. We base the atmospheric reconstruction on reanalysis data from 1948 to 2000, and use a constraint of sea-level pressure for 2001–2011. The pattern correlation scores appear to be significant most of the time, although score flaws are occasionally detected. Those flaws are mainly due to the time continuity constraint that is imposed on the reconstruction, which lowers the possibility of finding matching analogues. This method offers an ensemble of atmospheric reconstructions, and presents a computationally cheap alternative to data assimilation for a climate model, although with lower scores.},

abstract = {To better understand and manage climate risks in climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, it is essential to have access to consistent and reliable data and information products. Tailoring these products to the needs of the users they want to serve facilitate informed decision-making and downstream applications. This requires an in-depth understanding of users' needs and the context in which these users operate. Considering the diversity of the economic sectors and their actors it is extremely challenging if not outright impossible to promote the emergence of climate services without empowering a plethora of intermediate users who can act as one of the steps in a potential long knowledge brokers chain that connect the climate data providers and the end-users. In this context, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has been designed around the Climate Data Store (CDS), a unique entry point to a huge variety of quality-controlled climate data and high-level utilities to process that data to develop user-driven applications. Through the Sectoral Information System, C3S has then developed a series of sector specific applications, which show how the infrastructure can be used to address specific users' needs. This paper presents the key elements of the CDS and selected cases of sectoral application of C3S in agriculture.},

abstract = {The Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) facilitates the rapid, flexible inclusion of NASA observations into climate model evaluations. RCMES provides two fundamental components. A database (RCMED) is a scalable point-oriented cloud database used to elastically store remote sensing observations and to make them available using a space time query interface. The analysis toolkit (RCMET) is a Python-based toolkit that can be delivered as a cloud virtual machine, or as an installer package deployed using Python Buildout to users in order to allow for temporal and spatial regridding, metrics calculation (RMSE, bias, PDFs, etc.) and end-user visualization. RCMET is available to users in an "offline", lone scientist mode based on a virtual machine dynamically constructed with model outputs and observations to evaluate; or on an institution's computational cluster seated close to the observations and model outputs. We have leveraged RCMES within the content of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project, working with the University of Cape Town and other institutions to compare the model output to NASA remote sensing data; in addition we are also working with the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). In this paper we explain the contribution of cloud computing to RCMES's specifically describing studies of various cloud databases we evaluated for RCMED, and virtualization toolkits for RCMET, and their potential strengths in delivering user-created dynamic regional climate model evaluation virtual machines for our users. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {In January 2016, after two years of international negotiations, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into effect. The SDGs are the successors to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and represent an ambitious but potentially flawed agenda for sustainable development through to 2030. This review assesses the legacy of the MDGs, the development of the SDGs, and the international framework to put the SDGs into practice. We propose dividing the framework for SDG delivery into three key areas: implementing the goals and the SDG agenda (Implementation); monitoring, evaluation, and review (Monitoring); and increasing and improving global finance flows for sustainable development (Finance). This review identifies the challenges faced by the international community for making the SDGs an effective platform for equitable and sustainable development across these three areas. Proposed approaches and solutions are discussed and further research is suggested. This review concludes that further critical attention to the “Implementation”, “Monitoring”, and “Finance” framework is vital to ensure accountability and transparency from an ever-growing number of state and non-state development actors. This review also seeks to further the potential for greater links between development theory, development geography, and development actors and institutions to improve development under the SDGs and increase engagement from geography on the SDGs. This framework points towards a basis for critical engagement on the sustainability, equality, and quality of development, while challenging the primacy of economic growth-based paradigms in SDG implementation.},

abstract = {Numerous ongoing projects are upgrading climate observation networks to plug the climate data gap in Africa. Projects like trans-Africa hydromet observation (TAHMO) and climate for development in Africa (ClimDev-Africa) will avail increased data for early warning, modelling and research in African. In many cases however, historical climate data still remains on paper and thus beyond reach. As cited by IPCC assessments, the level of accessible climate literature from Africa continues to be significantly low, a situation exacerbated by both inadequate Internet connectivity and climate information that is either not captured or packaged for online and offline access. Poor Internet certainly impacts the access and findability of climate knowledge and research produced in Africa. Indigenous knowledge relied upon for generations in addition remains masked because its purveyors lack channels to codify and share the knowledge. Implementation of the Paris Agreement will entail data collection to monitor progress, as well as sharing of good practices, lessons, needs, challenges and opportunities at sub-national, national and regional levels. This paper will provide tested opportunities to facilitate sound knowledge management for implementation of the agreement by mobilizing pan-Africa climate knowledge partners to create a community for co-producing climate knowledge, sharing it and learning.},

In this study, we explore the cloud-based Web Processing Service (WPS) and present the Cloud WPS framework to support implementing Earth science model as WPS. Specifically, to make CMAQ easier to use for scientists through the latest standard-based Web service technology, CMAQ-WS, a prototype of CMAQ as a Service, is developed and tested. The result of the experiment shows the framework significantly improves not only the performance of but also ease of use of the CMAQ model thus providing great benefits to the environmental modeling community. Meanwhile, the proposed framework provides a general solution to integrate Earth science model, WPS, and cloud infrastructure, which can greatly reduce the workload of Earth scientists.},

Changes in cost of imagery and changes in computing technology over the last decade have enabled a new approach for how to organize, analyze, and share Earth observation imagery, broadly referred to as a data cube. The vision and promise of image data cubes is to lower these hurdles and expand the user community by making analysis ready data readily accessible and providing modern approaches to more easily analyze and visualize the data, empowering a larger community of users to improve their knowledge of place and make better informed decisions. Image data cubes are large collections of temporal, multivariate datasets typically consisting of analysis ready multispectral Earth observation data. Several flavors and variations of data cubes have emerged. To simplify access for end users we developed a flexible approach supporting multiple data cube styles, referencing images in their existing structure and storage location, enabling fast access, visualization, and analysis from a wide variety of web and desktop applications. We provide here an overview of that approach and three case studies.},

abstract = {Climate change adaptation is a complex human process, framed by uncertainties and constraints, which is difficult to capture in existing assessment models. Attempts to improve model representations are hampered by a shortage of systematic descriptions of adaptation processes and their relevance to models. This paper reviews the scientific literature to investigate conceptualisations and models of climate change adaptation, and the ways in which representation of adaptation in models can be improved. The review shows that real-world adaptive responses can be differentiated along a number of dimensions including intent or purpose, timescale, spatial scale, beneficiaries and providers, type of action, and sector. However, models of climate change consequences for land use and water management currently provide poor coverage of these dimensions, instead modelling adaptation in an artificial and subjective manner. While different modelling approaches do capture distinct aspects of the adaptive process, they have done so in relative isolation, without producing improved unified representations. Furthermore, adaptation is often assumed to be objective, effective and consistent through time, with only a minority of models taking account of the human decisions underpinning the choice of adaptation measures (14%), the triggers that motivate actions (38%) or the time-lags and constraints that may limit their uptake and effectiveness (14%). No models included adaptation to take advantage of beneficial opportunities of climate change. Based on these insights, transferable recommendations are made on directions for future model development that may enhance realism within models, while also advancing our understanding of the processes and effectiveness of adaptation to a changing climate.},

abstract = {To take advantage of the digital revolution, to accelerate research, to engage the power of machine analysis at scale while ensuring transparency, reproducibility and societal utility, data and other digital objects created by and used for research need to be FAIR. Advancing the global Open Science movement and the development of the European Open Science Cloud is the unambiguous objective for this report. This document is both a report and an action plan for turning FAIR into reality. It offers a survey and analysis of what is needed to implement FAIR and it provides a set of concrete recommendations and actions for stakeholders in Europe and beyond. It is our intention that it should provide a framework that will greatly assist the creation of the European Open Science Cloud, and will be applicable to other comparable initiatives globally},
